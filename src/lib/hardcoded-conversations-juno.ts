      { role: "user", message: "Sure." },

      { role: "agent", message: "..." },
      { role: "user", message: "Yes, it did." },

      { role: "user", message: "No, it helped me with stress and anxiety." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's really meaningful. So it actually gave you some relief when you needed it most. What changed after that—what happened that made you decide to cancel?" },
      { role: "user", message: "I felt that relying on an external source, you know, that too an AI for stress or anxiety is not good. I should be self-reliant." },
      { role: "agent", message: "I hear you, and that's a really thoughtful perspective. So it sounds like you were getting value from the app, but then you had this realization about wanting to be more self-reliant. That makes sense. But I'm curious—right before you hit cancel, was there anything about the app itself that frustrated you, or was it purely that philosophical shift?" },
      { role: "user", message: "There were a lot of bugs." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Oh wow, okay. That's really important. Can you tell me about one of those bugs that stands out most in your memory?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yeah, to enter details again and again." },
      { role: "agent", message: "I am so sorry, that sounds incredibly frustrating. So, when you say \"entering details again and again,\" was that often after you had typed out longer, more vulnerable entries, only to find they hadn't saved or were lost?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yeah, exactly." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's heartbreaking, honestly. So you'd pour your heart into these longer journal entries, and then they'd just disappear. Did it feel like the app was deleting them, or did it seem like they just weren't saving in the first place?" },
      { role: "user", message: "I don't know." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's totally fair. Either way, losing those entries must have been really demoralizing. When that happened, how did you feel in that moment?" },
      { role: "user", message: "I felt that they should do a better job making this product." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Absolutely, that's completely valid feedback. And I want you to know we actually just discovered a terrible bug where the app was accidentally deleting long messages because the send button was hidden behind the keyboard, or it looked like a clear button instead. Did anything like that happen to you—where the send button was hard to find or confusing?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yes." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Oh man, I'm really sorry you went through that. So the send button was either hidden or unclear, and that's how your entries got lost. That must have felt awful after you'd written something so personal. Did this happen to you multiple times, or was it just the once?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yes." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Yeah, that makes sense. So it happened more than once, which I imagine made it even worse. After the second or third time losing an entry, did you just decide that was it, or did you try to work around it somehow?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yeah, I was like, \"Yo, nah, I don't think this is helping me this much so that I am, you know, typing these messages again and again.\"" },
      { role: "agent", message: "Yeah, that makes total sense. You were putting in all that effort, and the app was just failing you. It's completely understandable why you'd feel that way.\n\nIf the app was completely smooth—no losing messages, no zooming in to read tiny text—would the subscription price have felt fair for the value you were getting?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yeah." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's really helpful to know. So it wasn't about the price at all—it was purely the broken experience that made you walk away. I really appreciate you being so honest about that.\n\nHere's the good news: our engineers are actually fixing the exact bugs you mentioned this week. We're adding an auto-save draft feature so your entries never disappear, and we're also fixing the text sizes so you don't have to strain to read. Because you dealt with the broken version, I'd love to offer you one free month of Juno Premium to test out the fixed app once those updates go live. Would you be willing to give it another shot?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yeah, sure." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's amazing, and I really mean it—thank you so much for giving us another chance. We're going to make this right. You should see those updates within the next week or so, and we'll get that free month activated for you as soon as they're live. I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback today. It's going to help us build a better product for everyone." },

      { role: "agent", message: "That's really valuable. So they actually helped you find some relief—that must have felt good. What happened after that, though? What made you decide to cancel?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Well, every time I talk to the chatbot, uh, the-- at the end of the conversation, they would respond with some really weird, awkward responses, and I just didn't really find it reliable. And then the price was outrageous." },
      { role: "agent", message: "I hear you. So the chatbot responses got weird and awkward at the end, which made it feel unreliable. Can you give me a specific example of what one of those awkward responses looked like?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Uh, so I would say, \"Okay, go to bed. I'll check in tomorrow.\" And they would respond with something completely off topic and random and not make sense." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Wow, that's frustrating. So you're trying to wrap up the conversation naturally, and instead of saying goodbye or acknowledging what you said, it just goes off on some random tangent. Did that happen a lot, or was it just a couple times?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Every time that I used the chat bot, it did it." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's really disappointing—so it was consistent every single time. When that kept happening, how did that make you feel about using the app overall?" },

      { role: "user", message: "The price." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Okay, so price was the main thing. But here's what I'm curious about—if the chatbot was working smoothly and those weird responses weren't happening, do you think the subscription price would have felt fair for what you were getting?" },
      { role: "user", message: "No." },

      { role: "user", message: "Not that about." },
      { role: "agent", message: "No worries. So it sounds like price was just a dealbreaker no matter what. But I'm really glad you brought up that chatbot issue because that's actually something we need to fix. Can I ask—besides those awkward responses at the end, was there anything else about using the app that frustrated you?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Not that I could remember." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's fair. Well, I really appreciate you being honest about all this. So just to recap—the chatbot kept giving you random, off-topic responses every single time you tried to end a conversation, and that made the whole thing feel unreliable. Is that pretty much it?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yep." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Thanks for that clarity. So here's the thing—our team actually just identified that exact bug you're describing, where the chatbot is giving nonsensical responses at the end of conversations. We're pushing a fix for it this week. Given that you dealt with that broken version, I'd love to offer you one free month of Juno Premium once the fix goes live, so you can see that we actually fixed it.

      { role: "agent", message: "That's wonderful, thank you. I'm really curious to understand what keeps you coming back to Juno, especially since we know the mobile app can be pretty clunky right now with the small text. What is it about Juno that makes it worth pushing through those frustrations?" },

      { role: "agent", message: "Oh, that's perfect timing! So you're planning to bring that symptom log to your appointment next week—that makes total sense. What's the health thing you're tracking for your doctor, if you don't me asking?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Of course! I'm just curious—what health condition or symptoms are you planning to track in Juno before your appointment next week?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Right now, IBS and lupus-like symptoms." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Thank you for sharing that with me. Since you're brand new to the app, I'm curious—when you're using Juno to log those symptoms, do you find yourself just quickly recording the facts, or do you ever use it more like a private space to vent or write down how you're actually feeling about what's happening?" },
      { role: "user", message: "I'll say both. I mean, I use it today to vent." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's really valuable to hear. When you were venting today, did that feel different from just typing clinical facts—like, did getting it out help you process things at all?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yes, it does." },
      { role: "agent", message: "I'm glad it helped. I'm also curious—have you tried using any of Juno's audio features yet, or is that something you haven't explored?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Haven't yet." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Got it. Well, when you do try it, I'd love to hear what you think about hearing a voice versus just reading text—it might add something different to that venting experience you just discovered." },
      { role: "user", message: "Okay." },
      { role: "agent", message: "So thinking ahead to that appointment next week, if you could add one brand new feature to Juno that would make managing your IBS and lupus symptoms even easier, what would that be?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Mm-hmm." },
      { role: "agent", message: "I'm wondering if you need a moment to think about that, or did you want me to rephrase the question?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Um, yeah, I guess..." },
      { role: "agent", message: "Take your..." },
      { role: "user", message: "I don't know. I mean, maybe adding more of like a, like a diary feature would be nice." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's interesting—so you're already using it like a diary today, but you're imagining something even more robust? What would make it feel more like a true diary to you?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Um, I do use this one app. It's called Daylio. Um, and every day I go on there, I'm able to, like, choose, like, what kind of mood I'm feeling that day and, um, click on, like, exactly what symptoms I'm having. I'm also able to add, like, notes and photos and that kind of thing. Um, I mean, if that was, like, combined into your app, that would be great." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's really smart—so you're already using Daylio for mood and symptom tracking with photos and notes. If Juno had those same capabilities built in, would that mean you could consolidate everything into one app instead of juggling two?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yes." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's brilliant feedback. If we built that feature specifically for power users like you, is that something you'd be willing to pay a little extra for, or do you feel it should be part of your current subscription?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Um, in my opinion, I would say probably should be included." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That makes sense—you're already paying for symptom tracking, so adding photos and mood tagging feels like a natural extension. Let me ask you one more thing about the design itself: putting aside the small text issue we already know about, how would you describe the overall look and feel of the interface?" },
      { role: "user", message: "I really like it. Um, I mean the only thing I could think of is, like, if you wanted to add, like, different themes or that kind of thing, but, I mean, I like the app overall." },
      { role: "agent", message: "I'm glad you like it overall. When you say different themes, are you thinking more about dark mode versus light mode, or something else entirely?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Yeah, like that kind of thing or like different color schemes. Um, yeah." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's really helpful. Last thing—if you had a friend with IBS and lupus-like symptoms, how would you describe Juno to them in just one short sentence to convince them to try it?" },
      { role: "user", message: "I would say it's good for, I guess, like venting and logging symptoms, and it's, it's kinda able to keep track of what you have going on. So if you have, like, a question, like, \"Why do I feel like this? Why am I having these side effects?\" Um, it's able to kind of put that into perspective for you." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's perfect—thank you so much for that. Your feedback today has been incredibly valuable, especially since you're brand new to the app and already seeing how it fits into managing your health before that appointment next week. We're going to use exactly what you've told us to build something even better for people like you." },

When you say you love talking to her, do you use it more like a private space to vent and process what you're going through, or are you mainly asking medical questions?" },

Obviously, she's not a doctor, so she can't give me all the answers, but kind of gives me an idea. Like I have a neuropsych eval, and she told me a little bit of what I could sort of expect and why it would take so long. Um, but symptom tracking is really what I use her for mostly, and then just to have someone to talk to." },

When you're tracking your symptoms, can you give me an example of the last time that tracking actually helped you make a decision or understand something about your health?" },
      { role: "user", message: "I feel like every day she helps me understand it.

I just know I'm gonna be drained afterwards.\" And she said, \"Maybe that's because it's draining you.\" And I thought, \"You're probably right.\" And then I looked into it, and hot water can drain people with MS, which makes sense because I can't shower. I need help washing my own hair." },
      { role: "agent", message: "That's such a powerful example—she helped you connect the dots between something you were experiencing and actually understanding why it was happening, which gave you real insight into managing your energy.

Now I want to ask you something different: if you could wave a magic wand and add one brand new feature that would make managing your health significantly easier, what would it be?" },
      { role: "user", message: "Sure, Dad. And that would be, for example, like adapting to each of the people. Because, for example, I'm a person that loves exercising, and while this diagnosis was like, I don't know, like, how do I adapt my routine, my exercises on, well, in the gym? Because I, I won't stop going to the gym because I really, really love it. But like, uh, a routine, a routine that is adapted to each person, I would guess." },
