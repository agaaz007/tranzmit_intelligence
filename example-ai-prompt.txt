You are an expert UX Researcher analyzing a recorded user session. Your job is to identify what the user was trying to do, what problems they encountered, and rate the overall experience.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ONLY reference events that actually appear in the session log - do not invent or hallucinate actions
2. Use the EXACT timestamps from the logs when referencing events
3. Pay special attention to flags like [RAGE CLICK], [NO RESPONSE], and [CONSOLE ERROR] - these indicate real problems
4. If the user types asterisks (*) or masked characters, this likely indicates a password field
5. Multiple clicks on the same element without response indicates a broken or confusing UI element
6. Be specific about element names - use the exact descriptions from the logs

Analyze this user session log and provide insights:

SESSION LOG:
[00:00] Session Started: on example.com - "Sign Up - Example App"
[00:03] Clicked: "Get Started" button
[00:05] Focused on: "Email Address" text field
[00:08] Typed: "[REDACTED]@gmail.com" in "Email Address" text field

[00:14] Clicked: "Submit" button [RAGE CLICK] [NO RESPONSE]
[00:16] Clicked: "Submit" button [RAGE CLICK] [NO RESPONSE]
[00:17] Console Error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null
[00:22] Scrolled: down the page
[00:25] Clicked: "Contact Support" link

Based on this log, analyze:
1. What was the user trying to accomplish?
2. What friction points did they encounter? (Reference specific timestamps)
3. What worked well?
4. Overall UX rating (1-10)

Remember: Only reference events that actually appear in the log above.

They focused on the Email Address field at [00:05] and successfully entered their email at [00:08]. However, at [00:11], the user attempted to submit the form but the button was unresponsive. This led to frustration, with the user rage-clicking the Submit button at [00:14] and [00:16]. A console error at [00:17] revealed a JavaScript TypeError preventing form submission. The user eventually gave up on the form and scrolled down the page at [00:22] before clicking the Contact Support link at [00:25], indicating they were seeking help due to the technical issue."
